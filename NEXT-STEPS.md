# 🎉 CNAME Setup Complete - Next Steps

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

I've successfully set up your GitHub Pages website with CNAME configuration. Here's what was done:

### 1. **CNAME File Created** ✅
- Created `/CNAME` file with suggested domain: `www.aggraphics.com`
- This file tells GitHub Pages what custom domain to use

### 2. **Missing Website Files Created** ✅

- Created `scripts/app.js` - Theme toggle functionality and smooth scrolling
- Fixed logo references (changed DGlogo.jpg → AGlogo.jpg) across all pages

### 3. **Documentation Added** ✅
- Created `README.md` - Overview of the website and repository
- Created `DOMAIN-SETUP.md` - Comprehensive domain setup guide
- Created this `NEXT-STEPS.md` file

### 4. **Website Status** ✅

## 🌐 About Free Domains and Custom Domains

### Important Clarification:
**You already have a FREE website!** Your site is live at:
**https://lekedada.github.io/AG-Graphics-Production/**

This is completely free and will always work.

### About "Free Custom Domains":
The CNAME file I created is used to connect a **custom domain name** to your GitHub Pages site. However:

❌ **There is no such thing as a truly "free" professional domain**
- Domain names like `.com`, `.net`, `.org` must be purchased (typically $8-20/year)
- "Free" domains (like `.tk`, `.ml`, `.ga`) exist but are:
  - Less professional looking
  - Often blocked by email providers
  - May have ads or restrictions
  - Not recommended for business use

### My Recommendation:
**Option A: Use your current free GitHub Pages URL** (Recommended for now)
- ✅ Already live: https://lekedada.github.io/AG-Graphics-Production/
- ✅ Completely free forever
- ✅ Professional enough for many businesses
- ✅ No additional setup needed

**Option B: Purchase a custom domain** (When budget allows)
- Cost: ~$10-15 per year
- Much more professional: `www.aggraphics.com`
- Better for marketing and branding
- See `DOMAIN-SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions
